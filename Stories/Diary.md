Today Alex, Dan and Me hung out. I know that I am living in the good old days, but that doesn't change the fact that its going bye too quickly. I am writing this down because I want to hold onto these memory's forever. Which is a foolish endeavor, I know. But Alex, Dan, and Jordan are important to me. They are the first people to care about me. But now it feels like everyone else is moving on. But that is always the case. I am the one left behind.

Trying to hold onto this environment is like trying to hold onto tap water, no matter what you do it just runs through your fingers.

Today I feel like I am going to vibrate apart if someone touches me wrong. I could just take a shot of redbull and let out a perficly cut screem before turning to dust.
